# EncryptionTool

# Basic Encryption/Decryption Tool

This is a simple encryption and decryption tool implemented in Python using Caesar Cipher and AES encryption algorithms.

## Features
- Encrypts and decrypts text using Caesar Cipher.
- Supports AES encryption for secure text handling.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shadeekshap/EncryptionTool.git


Install dependencies:
pip install cryptography


Run the encryption tool:
python encryption_tool.py


To encrypt or decrypt, follow the prompts in the terminal.
You will need to provide a shift value for the Caesar Cipher.


Example Usage:
To encrypt text using Caesar Cipher:

Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? e
Enter the text: Hello World!
Enter shift value: 3
Encrypted: Khoor Zruog!

To decrypt the encrypted text:

Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? d
Enter the text: Khoor Zruog!
Enter shift value: 3
Decrypted: Hello World!


Requirements
Python 3.x
Install dependencies: pip install cryptography
